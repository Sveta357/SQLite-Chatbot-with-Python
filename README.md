# SQLite-Chatbot-with-Python
This project provides a Python interface to interact with a SQLite database using natural language queries processed by OpenAI's GPT models. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT to parse natural language queries into SQL, execute them against a SQLite database, and return the results in a human-friendly format.
